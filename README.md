# Bitburner

Bitburner is a programming-based incremental game. Write scripts in JavaScript to automate gameplay, learn skills, play minigames, solve puzzles, and more in this cyberpunk text-based incremental RPG.

This repo contains a collection of the scripts I have written for the game. 

These scripts automate various ingame components such as hacking, running scripts when new servers can be hacked and automating the stock market.
